from pyspark.mllib.clustering import StreamingKMeans library is not available
Streaming is not accepting Labelled point datatype
Pyspark is not able to take sample appropriately
while running experimental source code of streamingkmeans it is leading to many other interrelated issues which I assume are beyond the scope of project
The streamingkmeans is not able to connect to Lightning visualization, so I am not able to show the visualizations
