1.The library pyspark.mllib.clustering import StreamingKMeans'  is not available
2.Streaming is not accepting Labelled point datatype
3.Pyspark is not able to take sample appropriately
4.while running experimental source code of streamingkmeans it is leading to many other interrelated issues which I assume are beyond the scope of project
5.The streamingkmeans is not able to connect to Lightning visualization, so I am not able to show the visualizations
